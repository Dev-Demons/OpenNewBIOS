WHAT THIS PACKAGE DOES

  ThinkPad stores various UEFI BIOS settings in its nonvolatile memory like
  Flash or EEPROM. These settings are configured by using the ThinkPad Setup
  menu. In general, this is done manually by the user. However, from a
  deployment point of view, the ThinkPad Setup settings are expected to be
  common to all machines and to be controlled remotely.
  This software is a Windows application for this purpose.

  Features:
  - Copy UEFI BIOS setup data settings
  - Copy UEFI BIOS secure data settings
  - Install and update for power-on password
  - Install for hard disk password
  - Copy supervisor password.

 
  This program is language independent and can be used with any language system.

CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE
  Version 2.12

[Important updates]
  Nothing.

[New functions or enhancements]
- Updated copyright 2015

[Problem fixes]
- Nothing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DETERMINING WHICH VERSION IS INSTALLED

  Run SRSETUPEWIN32.EXE/SRSETUPEWIN64.EXE with no parameter at the command prompt.
  Version information is displayed on the screen.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES

- Both the donor ThinkPad and a target ThinkPad must have the same UEFI BIOS
  Level.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO USE THE SOFTWARE

Note:
- If your computer runs satisfactorily now, it may not be necessary to update
  the software. To determine if you should update the software, refer to the
  Version Information section.
- You do not have to install the software. You need to copy SRSETUPEWIN32.EXE
  and SRSWDRV32.SYS for 32bit Windows to the same directory and copy
  SRSETUPEWIN64.exe and SRSWDRV64.SYS for 64bit Windows to the same directory.


---------------------------------
Capturing ThinkPad Setup Settings

  Do the following procedures at a donor ThinkPad:

  (Setting up a donor ThinkPad)
  1. Turn off the computer.
  2. Turn on the computer.
  3. While the following messages is displayed at the lower-left area of the
     screen, press the F1 key.
       To interrupt normal startup, press Enter
     The ThinkPad Setup menu will be displayed. If a password prompt appears,
     type the correct password.
  4. Change and save the desired settings as required. It is recommneded that
     the supervisor password is set at this time. This supervior password is
     copied to a target ThinkPad.
  5. Exit from the ThinkPad Setup and restart the computer.
  6. Ensure that the donor ThinkPad starts up and functions properly.

  (Starting capture)
  7. Boot Windows.
  8. For 32bit Windows, prepare SRSETUPEWIN32.EXE and SRSWDRV32.SYS to the same
     directory. For 64bit Windows, prepare SRSETUPEWIN64.EXE and SRSWDRV64.SYS
     to the same directory.
  9. Open Command Prompt as "Run as Administrator"
 10. At the command line, execute SRSETUPEWIN.EXE with the /c option.
       Example: SRSETUPEWIN.EXE \path\file_name /c
     Where \path\file_name is the path and file name of ThinkPad Setup Settings
     file to be created.


  (Capture options)
   [Secure data and Supervisor password]
     SRSETUPEWIN can capture UEFI BIOS secure data that includes a supervisor
     password. The captured data has an encrypted supervisor password of the
     donor ThinkPad. To capture the supervisor password, add the /kpap option to
     enter the password by the keyboard.
       Example: SRSETUPEWIN.EXE \path\file_name /c /kpap

   [Power-on password and Hard disk password]
     SRSETUPEWIN can deploy power-on password and hard disk password. To set the
     power-on password and hard disk password at the target ThinkPad computers,
     create a password.txt file (any name), add the /EP password.txt options.
       Example: SRSETUPEWIN.EXE \path\file_name /c /EP password.txt
     Where password.txt contains the names of UEFI BIOS settings files for each
     of target ThinkPad computers, the power-on password and the hard disk
     password. "Sample.txt" shows the format of .csv file.

     If the supervisor password is set on a donor ThinkPad, add the /kpap option
     to enter the password by the keyboard.
       Example: SRSETUPEWIN.EXE \path\file_name /c /kpap /EP password.txt
     In this case, the ThinkPad Setup Settings file contains a supervisor
     password.

     WARNING:
     This process creates an intermediate file that contains the power-on
     password, hard disk password and a pointer to the system that these
     passwords are intended to be installed on. Be sure to treat this
     intermediate file as a potential security exposure that exists until the
     reset process is complete. Be sure to transmit the file securely to the
     target system and to destroy the file when finished. Examples of secure
     transmission include carrying the file on removable media to the target
     system or encrypting the file before transmission over the network to the
     target system.

------------------------------------
Playing Back ThinkPad Setup Settings

  Do the following procedures at a target ThinkPad:

  (Starting playback)
  1. Set supervisor password to a target ThinkPad.
  2. Boot Windows.
  3. For 32bit Windows, prepare SRSETUPEWIN32.EXE and SRSWDRV32.SYS to the same
     directory. For 64bit Windows, prepare SRSETUPEWIN64.EXE and SRSWDRV64.SYS
     to the same directory.
  4. Copy the ThinkPad Setup Settings file in the step 10 of the "Capturing
     ThinkPad Setup Settings".
  5. Open Command Prompt as "Run as Administrator"
  6. At the command line, execute SRSETUPEWIN.EXE with the /u option.
       Example: SRSETUPEWIN.EXE \path\file_name /u /kpap
     Where \path\file_name is the path and file name of ThinkPad Setup Settings
     file. And type the superviosr password setting in Step1.
  4. Restart, the computer.

  (Notes)
   A target ThinkPad must have superviosr password beforehand.

   [Power-on password and Hard disk password]
     If the target computer already has a power-on password and/or a hard disk
     password, you can not set the passwords by SRSETUPEWIN. You must remove the
     passwords by ThinkPad Setup Utility at the target computer.

   When Secure Boot of the target ThinkPad is Enabled, its Secure Boot setting
   can not be changed to Disabled even when the Secure Boot setting of the donar
   ThinkPad is Disabled.
