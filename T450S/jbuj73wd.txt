WHAT THIS PACKAGE DOES

  This package provides the ISO image file of UEFI BIOS which is compatible with
  CD/DVD/BD writing software to create the CD/DVD/BD for the UEFI BIOS update.
  Hereafter the CD/DVD/BD for the UEFI BIOS update is called as "BIOS Update CD".

  The BIOS Update CD can boot the computer disregarding the operating systems
  and update the UEFI BIOS (including system program and Embedded Controller
  program) stored in the Lenovo computer to fix problems, add new functions,
  or expand functions as noted below.

  For that purpose, it is necessary to have the CD/DVD/BD writing software (with
  CD/DVD/BD creation function from the ISO image file) prepared separately.

  Also, any one of the following types of CD-RW, CD-RW & DVD Combo, DVD, DVD
  Multi, BD or other optical drives should be prepared. (Hereafter these drives
  are called as "optical drive".)
  - USB

  This program is language independent and can be used with any language system.

NOTES

- You should install the CD/DVD/BD writing software which supports CD/DVD/BD
  creation function from the ISO image file to create the BIOS Update CD.

- To boot the computer from the BIOS Update CD, you should have any one of the
  following types of optical drives.
  - USB
  Any types of other optical device like ExpressCard device are not supported.

- To boot the computer from the BIOS Update CD, you may need to change the boot
  device setting in your Lenovo computer. Refer to the "Prepare boot device"
  section in this document.

- The contents of the BIOS Update CD can not be shown by Windows Explorer.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
